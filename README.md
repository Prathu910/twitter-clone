I have mad an Twitter clone FRITTER. In this web app I have included some functionalities like Like/Dislike, Retweet, Adding a new Tweet and Reply to the particular Tweet. Also design wise I have added a Dark Mode toggle.

Also the data is added to Localstorage so that the tweets and replies that are done by user will be available to them.
